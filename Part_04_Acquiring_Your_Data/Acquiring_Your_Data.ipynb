    "- [The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Must Know About Unicode in 2023](https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/)\n",
    "- [Unicode is harder than you think](https://mcilloni.ovh/2023/07/23/unicode-is-hard/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Text encoding is the process of converting characters (letters, numbers, symbols) into a sequence of bytes that computers can store, process, and transmit. Since computers fundamentally operate with binary data, encoding serves as the bridge between human-readable text and machine-readable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ASCII encoding, which has 128 characters, only 95 of which are printable. The good news about ASCII encoding is that it’s the lowest common denominator of most data exchange. The bad news is that it doesn’t begin to handle the complexities of the many alphabets and writing systems of the world. Reading files using ASCII encoding is almost certain to cause trouble and throw errors on character values that it doesn’t understand, whether it’s a German ü, a Portuguese ç, or something from almost any language other than English.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to mitigate this confusion is Unicode. The Unicode encoding called UTF-8 accepts the basic ASCII characters without any change but also allows an almost unlimited set of other characters and symbols according to the Unicode standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of its flexibility, UTF-8 was used in more 85% of web pages served at the time I wrote this chapter, which means that your best bet for reading text files is to assume UTF-8 encoding. If the files contain only ASCII characters, they’ll still be read correctly, but you’ll also be covered if other characters are encoded in UTF-8. The good news is that the Python 3 string data type was designed to handle Unicode by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with Unicode, there’ll be occasions when your text contains values that can’t be successfully encoded. Fortunately, the open function in Python accepts an optional errors parameter that tells it how to deal with encoding errors when reading or writing files. The default option is 'strict', which causes an error to be raised whenever an encoding error is encountered. Other useful options are 'ignore', which causes the character causing the error to be skipped; 'replace', which causes the character to be replaced by a marker character (often, ?)."

Later on, this character stream can then be retrieved and de-serialized back to a Python object. Pickling is not to be confused with compression!

    "    - Authorization: Contains credentials for authenticating the request.\n",

    "    - 5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill a valid request (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).\n",

    "Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting information from websites. Unlike manually copying and pasting data, web scraping leverages automated tools and scripts to collect large volumes of data from web pages. This practice has become a cornerstone in the fields of data science, market research, and competitive analysis, as it allows organizations and individuals to harvest publicly available data at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, web scraping involves sending HTTP requests to web servers, retrieving the HTML content of web pages, and then parsing that content to extract structured data. This process typically includes:\n",
    "- **Sending Requests**: Using libraries (such as Python’s requests) to fetch web pages.\n",
    "- **Parsing HTML**: Employing parsers (like BeautifulSoup, lxml, or Scrapy) to navigate the HTML structure and locate desired elements.\n",
    "- **Data Extraction**: Extracting and cleaning the data, often converting it into structured formats like CSV, JSON, or databases for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is used in a variety of contexts, including:\n",
    "- Data Collection for Research: Aggregating information from multiple sources to analyze trends, sentiment, or market behavior.\n",
    "- Competitive Analysis: Monitoring competitor websites for changes in pricing, product offerings, or user reviews.\n",
    "- Content Aggregation: Compiling information from different websites to create consolidated resources (such as news aggregators or comparison platforms).\n",
    "- Machine Learning and Data Science: Gathering large datasets for training machine learning models, especially when data is not readily available in structured formats."

    "While web scraping is a powerful tool, it must be **conducted ethically and legally**. Misuse can lead to overloading servers, violating terms of service, or even legal repercussions. Two key ethical guidelines are adhering to the rules set by a website’s `robots.txt` file and **implementing proper rate limiting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adhering to robots.txt**\n",
    "- What Is robots.txt?: The robots.txt file is a public file hosted on websites that instructs web crawlers on which parts of the site should not be accessed or scraped. It serves as a guideline for responsible crawling and is located at the root of the website (e.g., https://www.example.com/robots.txt).\n",
    "- Why It Matters: Respecting the robots.txt directives is crucial for ethical scraping. It helps prevent server overload, protects sensitive areas of the website, and ensures that you are complying with the site owner's policies. Even though robots.txt is not legally binding in many jurisdictions, ignoring it can lead to reputational damage and potential legal challenges.\n",
    "- Practical Steps: Before scraping a website, review its robots.txt file to understand which sections are off-limits. Libraries like Scrapy have built-in support for parsing robots.txt files, making it easier to automatically comply with these guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementing Rate Limiting**\n",
    "- Definition and Importance: Rate limiting is the practice of controlling the frequency of requests made to a server. Excessive requests in a short period can strain the server’s resources and result in being blocked or blacklisted by the website.\n",
    "- Strategies for Rate Limiting:\n",
    "    - Delay Between Requests: Introduce a pause (e.g., using time.sleep()) between consecutive requests to mimic human browsing behavior.\n",
    "    - Randomized Delays: Implement random delays within a specified range to avoid pattern detection.\n",
    "    - Adaptive Rate Limiting: Monitor server responses (e.g., HTTP status codes) and adjust the request rate dynamically, especially if you begin to receive warnings or error codes like 429 (Too Many Requests).\n",
    "- Best Practices:\n",
    "    - Respect Server Load: Start with conservative request intervals and gradually increase if the server is handling the load without issues.\n",
    "    - Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to manage temporary server errors or timeouts gracefully.\n",
    "    - User-Agent Identification: Use a clear and descriptive User-Agent header to identify your scraper. This transparency can help site administrators contact you if your activities cause issues."

If it is False, it will only look at direct child elements.\n",
    "- The `string` argument is used to perform matching based on the text content of elements.\n",

Note that find is functionally equivalent to calling find_all with the limit set to 1, with the exception that the former returns the retrieved element directly, and that the latter will always return a list of items, even if it just contains a single element.
