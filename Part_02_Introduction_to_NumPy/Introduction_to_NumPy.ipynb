    "## What is NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy (Numerical Python) is an **open source Python library that’s used in almost every field of science and engineering**. It’s the universal standard for working with numerical data in Python, and it’s at the core of the scientific Python and PyData ecosystems. NumPy users include everyone from beginning coders to experienced researchers doing state-of-the-art scientific and industrial research and development.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is the **fundamental package for scientific computing in Python**. It is a Python library that provides a **multidimensional array object**, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "> At the core of the NumPy package, is the **ndarray** object.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several important differences between NumPy arrays and the standard Python sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy arrays have a **fixed size at creation**, unlike Python lists (which can grow dynamically). Changing the size of an ndarray will create a new array and delete the original.\n",
    "- The elements in a NumPy array are **all required to be of the same data type**, and thus will be the **same size in memory**. The exception: one can have arrays of (Python, including NumPy) objects, thereby allowing for arrays of different sized elements.\n",
    "- NumPy arrays **facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations** on large numbers of data. Typically, such operations are executed more efficiently and with less code than is possible using Python’s built-in sequences.\n",
    "- A growing plethora of scientific and mathematical Python-based packages are using NumPy arrays. The NumPy API is used extensively in Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, scikit-image and most other data science and scientific Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons NumPy is so important for numerical computations in Python is because it is designed for efficiency on large arrays of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy-based algorithms are generally 10 to 100 times faster (or more) than their pure Python counterparts and use significantly less memory."

The general rule with situations like these it to choose the one that makes your code easier to read, which will pay dividends both as you start working with data in teams, and when you have to refer back to code you wrote some time ago. You will find that for these arithmetic operations, it's much more common to use the built-in Python operators than the functions.\n",

If you adopt the matrix convention for indexing, then this means the matrix is stored one column at a time (since the first index moves to the next row as it changes). Thus Fortran is considered a Column-major language. C has just the opposite convention. In C, the last index changes most rapidly as one moves through the array as stored in memory. Thus C is a Row-major language. The matrix is stored by rows. Note that in both cases it presumes that the matrix convention for indexing is being used, i.e., for both Fortran and C, the first index is the row. Note this convention implies that the indexing convention is invariant and that the data order changes to keep that so.\n"
